# Forest Fire Prediction
The model is trained in Colab Notebook, based on Jupyter Notebooks to predict the forest fire with various features like ISI index, temperature, rainfall etc.
The main code which i reffered was the "califronia_house_dataset" from Google's Crash Course on AI.
I modified that little bit and this model worked really fine.
You,ll just have to change input features, synthesised feature, data set and some other features to get the code running.
The final RMSE error was near about 20.xx and the graphs of training data and the validation data set almost intersected each other. 
The code doesnt contain anything like feature crossing or regularisation because i didnt feel a need for the same.
Code works fine in Colab Notebooks provided by google. Just you'll have to select, python2(because "print" gives error) and GPU(for better performance!) from the runtime option.
New codes for Diabetes and Breast cancer prediction will be on the way!
